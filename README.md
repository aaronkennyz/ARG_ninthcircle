    i created the repository and two webpages . one being the landing page and the second being the  access door to part2
    there are two designs , one was a retro 1980s style UI . the other is  a modern themed UI . I havent decided which UI to use yet .
    The structure of the ARG is yet to be decided , including the clues and the main storyline. The landing pages are also to server as motivation for us to finish this project , so we dont abandon it like we usually do . (kenbriselleris)
